Karfu'R is a project to offer a better experience to refugees arriving in France as per their integration and their administrative process. Karfu'R is a project hosted by the DIAIR (Direction Interministérielle pour l'Accueil et l'Intégration des Réfugiés), a service of the French Ministry of Interior.

The goal is to offer a personnalized navigation to the user, to emphasize on the items they might need more, given the information the user has chosen to provide.
